   to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or segmental instability.
   Findings must correlate with clinical presentation.

2. NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT
   At least 3 months (12 weeks) of non-operative treatment including supervised
   physical therapy with documented attendance and functional progress measures.

3. NEUROLOGICAL OR FUNCTIONAL CRITERIA
