Dear Medical Director,

I am writing to request prior authorization for total joint arthroplasty
(CPT [CPT Codes]) for the above-referenced patient. As the treating orthopedic
surgeon, I have determined this procedure to be medically necessary based on the
following clinical evidence.

CLINICAL HISTORY
[Patient demographics, presenting complaint, duration of symptoms, impact on
activities of daily living. Include relevant medical history and comorbidities
such as diabetes status (HbA1c), BMI, cardiac history.]

RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS
[Detail weight-bearing radiograph results:
- Kellgren-Lawrence grading (Grade 1-4)
- Joint space narrowing (medial/lateral compartments)
- Osteophyte formation
- Subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation
- Alignment (varus/valgus deformity in degrees)
Reference the imaging date and modality.]

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT HISTORY
[Physical therapy: number of visits, dates, specific exercises, functional outcomes
Medication trials: each drug with dose, duration, and response
Injection therapy: corticosteroid and/or viscosupplementation with dates and response
Activity modification and assistive devices used]

FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT
[Validated outcome scores:
- WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)
  Total score and subscales: pain, stiffness, physical function
- KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) if available
- Description of specific ADL limitations: stairs, walking distance, standing tolerance
- Use of assistive devices (cane, walker)]

MEDICAL NECESSITY
[Point-by-point alignment with payer policy criteria. Address each criterion
individually with specific patient evidence. Include why surgical intervention is
the appropriate next step given failure of all conservative measures.]

CONCLUSION
Based on the clinical evidence presented, total joint arthroplasty is the appropriate
next step in treatment. The patient has exhausted conservative options and continues
to experience significant functional decline. I respectfully request authorization
for this medically necessary procedure.
